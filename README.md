# Hands-On Machine Learning 📚🤖

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and resources for my **Hands-On Machine Learning** course, which I am recording and uploading to YouTube.

The goal of this course is to provide a practical, step-by-step guide to learning Machine Learning using Python, with examples and exercises inspired by the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow*.
